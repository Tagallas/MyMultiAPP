TO DO App

Mobile App python project in kivy/kivymd, converted by buildozer to ".exe" format

App has:
- modern, tidy and easy to use gui
- a lot of details (that allows to use app in practical way)

Project functionalities:
- label managment
- task managment (adding, edditing, removing, marking complete)
- sorting tasks (by priority, task deadline, category)
- adding photo tasks (you take photo then app semi-automaticaly cuts it to different tasks and converts to gray format)

Soon will be added:
- calledar view (where you can see task for specific day/week)
- push up notifications (when task will soon meet the deadline)
